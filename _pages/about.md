This is Ranyiliu Chen(陈然一鎏)'s homepage on the web!

I am an assistant researcher at [Quantum Science Center of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area(QSCGBA, 粤港澳大湾区量子科学中心)](https://www.qscgba.org.cn/#/site), a visiting scholar at [QuAIR group, HKUST-GZ](https://xinwang.group). I am currently working on entanglement, "the spooky action at a distance", in the context of self-testing and non-local games. But I am also curious about general stuff in quantum info.

Previously, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics with Prof. [Laura Mančinska](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/staff/?pure=en/persons/604782) at [QMATH](https://qmath.ku.dk), University of Copenhagen. I did my master's and bachelor's degree both with Prof. [Tao Shang(尚涛)](https://cst.buaa.edu.cn/info/1111/2767.htm) at Beihang University. I also did a 1-year internship at [IQC, Baidu Research](https://quantum.baidu.com) with Dr. [Xin Wang(王鑫)](https://www.xinwang.info).

In my adolescence I studied in [Yali(雅礼)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yali_High_School), where I met most of my friends for life and grew my interest in science and math.

BTW, Please feel free to call me Chen :)
