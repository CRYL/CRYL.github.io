We show that there is some entanglement witness that cannot witness any maximally entangled states. At the first sight it seems to be the opposite: the maximally entangled states contains the `most' entanglement in some sense, so at least one of them should be detected by a fixed entanglement witness. Unfortunately it does not hold.

Let $\operatorname{MAXE}$ be the set of all maximally entangled state, $\operatorname{SEP}$ be the set of separable states. We first show that the convex hull of $\operatorname{MAXE}\cup\operatorname{SEP}$ is closed.

The convex hull
\begin{align*}
    \operatorname{cov}\{\operatorname{MAXE}\cup\operatorname{SEP}\}:=\{\rho|\rho=\sum_jp_j\rho_j,\rho_j\in\operatorname{MAXE}\cup\operatorname{SEP},p_j\ge0,\sum_jp_j=1\}
\end{align*}
is closed.

Aren't headings cool?
